# Delivery Time Prediction using Sorting Time

## Project Overiview
This project focuses on predicting "Delivery Time" based on "Sorting Time" data. The goal is to optimize logistics and resource allocation while improving customer satisfaction.

## Data
The project employs a dataset with information on "Delivery Time" and "Sorting Time." This dataset is used to train and evaluate the prediction model.

## Analysis and Models
The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of predictive models. Three different data splits (70:30, 75:25, and 80:20) are used to build and evaluate models.

## Results
The project's success is measured through key metrics:
- R2 Score: The model's ability to explain the variance in Delivery Time.
- RMSE: The average prediction error.

The ideal model, with a 75:25 split, achieved an R2 score of 79.8%, with the RMSE value of 2.54


# Salary Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a prediction model for employee salaries based on their years of experience. Accurate salary predictions can support human resources and workforce planning.

## Data
The project uses a dataset containing "Years of Experience" and corresponding "Salary" data. This dataset serves as the foundation for the prediction model.

## Analysis and Models
The project involves data preprocessing and the development of predictive models. Different data splits(70:30, 75:25, and 80:20) are used to assess model performance.

## Results
The project's performance is assessed using key metrics:
- R2 Score: The extent to which the model explains salary variance.
- RMSE: The average prediction error.

The ideal model achieved an R2 score of 94.39% and an RMSE of 5917.58
